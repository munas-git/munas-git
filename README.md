- I’m a versatile Data Scientist who helps businesses make better, faster, and more confident decisions through data — from dashboards to forecasting, machine learning to GenAI.
- I’ve delivered value across industries through projects involving:
   - **Planning & Forecasting**: Inventory optimization, supply planning, and demand modeling
   - **Operational Monitoring**: Real-time KPI dashboards, alert systems, and anomaly detection
   - **Customer & Marketing Analytics**: Segmentation, conversion optimization, personalization strategies
   - **Business Intelligence & Ad-hoc Analysis**: Executive dashboards, root cause analysis, stakeholder-ready visuals
   - **Experimentation & Testing**: Funnel analysis, A/B testing frameworks, campaign performance insights
- I’m comfortable using a wide range of tools (Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, LangChain) and I adapt quickly to new domains and challenges.
- Open to roles in **analytics, business intelligence, product data, or applied machine learning**. Basically, anywhere data meets business decisions.
